Project Name: Transformer Outage
Objective:  To identify whether electricity transformer outage happen or not based on various metrics.
Tools: Python, Python Flask, Github and Heroku
Techniques: Decision Forest, Logistic Regression and Random Forest
Data collection, Data preprocessing, Analysis and Model building process:
Gathered the information on the business scenario, Major work is data generation for analysis purpose, listed all the features that effect the transformer outage. Categorized the data as numeric and non-numerical and defined the range for all factors. Created the dummy by considering the factors such as observations recorded as per defined. After data collection, Exploratory data analysis has been performed using python and drawn inferences for the factors. Variables were checked for the normality and used scatter plot to detect the correlation between variables and as checked there is no collinearity problem exists. Built different models such as Regression, Decision tree and Random forest, used the model with best result and validated the model.  Random Forest Model is implemented based on accuracy after removing the overfitting problem and it helped the organization to reduce the outages based on analytical model.
